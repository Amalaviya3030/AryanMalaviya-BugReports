**Describe the bug**
A website named PTE Career allows users to sign up for a new account using a temporary email address, thereby reducing the number of permanent users of the website.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open the PTE career website.
2. Click the "Sign up" button to start creating a new account.
3. Provide a name, password, and temporary email address (such as a Mylantor or Tempmile account) on the registration form
4. Fill in the capture for verification.
5. Click on the submit button to register

**Expected behavior**
While signing up, the website should check whether the filled mail address is temporary or permanent. If temporary mail is used, then an error message will appear, and if the mail address is valid and non-temporary, then the website will allow the user to register successfully.
