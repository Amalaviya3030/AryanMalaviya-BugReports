**problem**
A website named PTE Career allows users to sign up for a new account using a temporary email address

**Describe the solution**
To verify whether the email address entered during the sign-up process is valid or not, the email address validation system is used to check whether the email address is disposable or temporary. Also, check whether it is temporary or permanent so the user cannot sign up for a new account using a temporary mail address.
